# CulinaryAI v2.0

CulinaryAI is a Chat-GPT3 powered web application that suggests recipes based on users preferred ingredients and exclusions. New suggestions are generated each time and user's are able to save recipes to their associated Google accounts.

## NOTE:

Currently using trial premium hosting option from netifly, once finished, API fetching longer than 10s will cause an error.

## Technologies

I used `Next.js` for the frontend/backend (used API routing). `MongoDB` to store data and `TailWindCSS` for styling. `OAuth` was used for user authentication.

## Setup

- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`

## Approach

I wanted to integrate the power of AI endpoints to facilitate those who do not know what to do with scattered ingredients in their fridges. I knew recipe makers already exist, but none use the power of AI to make
tailored suggestions towards the user. I hope to add a better UI for the recipe maker itself and more options, perhaps surrounding "themed" foods.

## Status

Minimal viable product currently, plan to add more features surrounding recipe types and collaboration.
